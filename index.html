         My PhD is focused on multimodal analytics of multilingual news articles, with a specific emphasis on inferring and distinguishing geospatial, events and temporal information within news narratives. My objective is to employ advanced multimodal machine learning techniques to effectively bridge the gaps between visual and textual modalities. Furthermore, I aim to enrich news documents by integrating external knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the contextualization of news content. The contextualization is important to organize and analyze news documents in various applications such as fake news detection, fact checking, and news retrieval.

          As an Early Stage Researcher (ESR) in the CLEOPATRA ITN, a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network, I was responsible for facilitating advanced cross-lingual processing of event-centric textual and visual information through development of novel methods for extraction, verification and contextualisation of multilingual information. Additionally, my role in the FakeNarratives project aimed at understanding narratives of disinformation in public and alternative news videos has empowered me to directly confront one of the most significant real-world challenges.

                      Event classification in images plays a vital role in multimedia analysis especially with the prevalence of fake news on social media and the Web. The majority of approaches for event classification rely on large sets of labeled training data. However, image labels for fine-grained event instances (e.g., 2016 Summer Olympics) can be sparse, incorrect, ambiguous, etc. A few approaches have addressed the lack of labeled data for event classification but cover only few events. Moreover, vision-language models that allow for zero-shot and few-shot classification with prompting have not yet been extensively exploited. In this paper, we propose four different techniques to create hard prompts including knowledge graph information from Wikidata and Wikipedia as well as an ensemble approach for zero-shot event classification. We also integrate prompt learning for state-of-the-art vision-language models to address few-shot event classification. Experimental results on six benchmarks including a new dataset comprising event instances from various domains, such as politics and natural disasters, show that our proposed approaches require much fewer training images than supervised baselines and the state-of-the-art while achieving better results.
